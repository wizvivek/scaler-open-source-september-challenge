## Welcome to Challenge 7

Welcome to the 7th challenge! Today we will learn about the concept of Git Reset. 

Today's the task focus is to create an additional commit in your branch. And then remove that commit that has been pushed from the pull request created in previous challenges. The main purpose of this is because there can be times when you might push an unncessary or wrong commit and you way want to remove it from your pull request. 

This can be done by using the following command: ``git reset``

Here is an article you can refer to for understanding how git reset works: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-reset#:~:text=a%20shared%20repository.-,Summary,Index%2C%20and%20the%20Working%20Directory.

So the task is to identity the commit id of the commit you want to remove, use the git reset command, and remove the commit from the pull request by force pushing into it. 


Task: 
1. Inside the branch you created during the prior challenges in your local forked repository, make a new file by the name of ``your-github-username-2.md`` and add any details you may want to add to this markdown file and push the change to your forked repository.

2. Ensure the change appears in the Pull request created in previous challenges

3. Identify the commit id for the commit you just made and use the git reset command to remove the commit from your local branch. Note: Use git reset and force push, to remove the commit from your pull request. 

4. Share a screenshot of this, in the issue you created in previous challenges. 

5. Update your Discord forum post you created with the Challenge 7.
