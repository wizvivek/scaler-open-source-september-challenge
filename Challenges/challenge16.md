In this 2 part challenge, we will try to emulate and fix merge conflicts via git. 

Today is the first part of this challenge: 

Task: 
1. Sync Your Repository:

- Update your Forked Repository From the Original [Main Repository](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge) locally. Also ensure that your branch ``your_github_username-details`` is also synced with the latest changes from the original repository. 

2. In your branch ``your_github_username-details`` open the ``challengers-list.md`` file.
Add your name to the list of challengers, following the format specified in the file.


3. Push your changes to reflect them in the Pull Request created in previous challenges.
Please note that by adding your name to the same file in a collaborative environment, this task may create a merge conflict when multiple participants attempt to push their changes simultaneously. Be prepared to resolve any conflicts that arise.


4. Add a new comment to the issue you created in the first task with the screenshot of the updated ``challengers-list.md`` file in your forked repository.



Note: Next Challenge: Challenge 17 will focus on resolving merge conflicts.
