## Welcome to Challenge 14

Welcome to the 14th Challenge 

Today's challenge is a re-practice of the 8th and 9th Challenge. 

So focus for this challenge will be to practice the ``git rebase`` command.

Ensure to practice the ``git rebase`` command by creating your own local git repository. You can checkout this guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-squash-explained/

Task: 
1. Practice git rebase, and how to squash commit using git rebase in your local projects. For this you can make some changes in the branch and the file created in Challenge 3 & 5. 
2. Once done, try to squash the commits in your pull request in the Challenge repository. 
3. Also do sign your commits, covered in the Challenge 12.
