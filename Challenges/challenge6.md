## Welcome to Challenge 6

Welcome to the sixth challenge!

Today's goal is to update your pull request that you created in [Challenge 5](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge5.md)

Task
1. Create a new commit in the branch you created in Challenge 2 in your forked repository 
2. The change that you have to make should be the following: 
In the markdown file that was created in Challenge 5, edit the details as follows: 
```
---
name: your_name
github_user_name: YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME
url_of_github_issue: Link_of_the_github_issue_created_in_first_challenge 
---
```
Note: The url_of_github_issue should be the link of the github issue that you created in Challenge 1.

3. After making this change create a commit with a proper commit message and push the changes to your forked repository
4. Check if the commit reflects in the Pull request you created in Challenge 5 in the main challenge repository.

( If it does not, then sync your forked repository with the main repository and push the changes to your forked repository.)
